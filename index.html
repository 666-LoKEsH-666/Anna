                hey honey,<br>

I’m just sitting here and thinking about you (as always), I’ve got to say,<br>

i never and will not take you for granted,<br>

I’m so grateful that you entered my life.<br>

i really want you to know how much you mean to me.<br>
isn’t it so wierd, all these yrs being this close to each other,<br>
now, we are talking to each other,you were there always<br>

now i get it when u say “Destiny”.<br>

when i first started talking to you on the call, i thought holding the conversation for 20 minutes would be a big thing and thats it,<br>

the magic has started one month later,here we are.<br>

i really like the way u say “cha” and i want to kiss u when u sneeze,even if i get that i know it will be worth every second.<br>

im very happy when i talk tou you, i want to do deeds for you,<br>
i quit my addictions for you,<br>
i can’t even beleive i started believing in god and destiny and stuff.<br>

i want jump off here and die, become a ghost to come see you when u  say <br>

”good night Honey” “miss u honey” “love you Honey” and come to you becasue that’s the only fastest way i can be with you.<br>

i love the snaps u send only to me,it makes me feel special.<br>

You know that i’ll always be a pillar of support when u need me.<br>
I found the best girl in the wrong generation,there is no way I’m letting you go now.<br>

i’ve made a lot of mistakes and yes its my fault, i regret it a lot.I’m sorry.<br>

So,please understand,this is all new to me, and i may take some time to get used to this..so please bear with me, i love you so much.<br>

when i told i will fix you, i really meant it and i can see<br>

the only regret that never ends  is not talking to you before.<br>

To say I love you to the moon and back would be an understatement.<br>
NO… Even when the moon disappears, my love remains.<br>

you are perfect in an imperfect way.<br>

Take ur time,i’llwait for you, waqt toh bahut hai humare pas…me bas intezar karte rahunga<br>

Therinjo theriyamalo una neriya hurt paniruken... Othukuren...ni enaku evlo importance kudukaranu puriyudhu...enaku idhela nejama romba pudhusa irunchuu...en side enala muduncha alavuku I will give my best!!!Now I can't let to u feel bad!!! Puriyudhaa??? I promise!!<br>

(please don’t lose your trust in me… i know you already lost it by now..but please let me build that..even though u don’t beleive in it)<br>



            </p>
